# Protobuf contracts usage in Akka

### TODO:
- error handling, 
- proper connection handling, 
- serialization/deserialization error handling

Also, the Akka Stream source needs to be implemented based on how we're receiving messages from RabbitMQ 
(e.g., using Alpakka library for integration with Akka Stream).
